### Description

This is a project I started months ago, almost a year, and finished to the best of my abilities at the time. It works completely, with just a few kinks (load time for large folders of MP3's, etc). I hope some of the coding comes in handy for some users out there, some code came from PSC, sorry if you recognize your code, but I wasn't planning on selling this or anything. So here it is, a sound system for your computer for doing music and adding sub sounds with LOTS of really good code involved. Has crossfading timer and all....
 
### More Info
 
Just use the built in browser to load up MP3's and let em rock...
